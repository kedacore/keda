# Vision
Syna Theme is a community project. From our current viewpoint, its role is:
This project thrives to be the goto theme for websites using Hugo.

## Core Concept
Built a modular theme to be easily extendible with a default library of fragments available.

## General Aim
Syna provides a generic solution to easily get up and running, but doesn't consider hugely specialized solutions to be integrated.

## Communication
A lot of discussion about Syna Theme happens within Github issues. Ideally, we will keep it that way until Syna Theme becomes big enough that this turns into a problem. The advantages of this is that all documentation and issues are publicly searchable and easily linked to the source code.

## Contributions
The Syna Theme project should always aim to devote a lot of time to making contributors feel like an important part of the community. We should strive to provide a place for anyone to be able to contribute. The aim of the core team should be to work on ways to showcase contributions, encourage adoption and show off great work. An example of where this worked is the [CocoaPods Quality Index](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods.org-Two-point-Five/).
