Fragments and various elements can be customized further using Bootstrap color classes.
These colors are customized within `config.toml` to fit the Syna theme.

| class     | colors  |
| --------- | ------- |
| primary   | #00838F |
| secondary | #868e96 |
| success   | #008f54 |
| info      | #00838F |
| warning   | #fdf314 |
| danger    | #dc1200 |
| light     | #f8f9fa |
| dark      | #343a40 |

Classes are mainly used for backgrounds and button colors.  
Links, inline code and other elements will also be changed.
