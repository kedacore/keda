This fragment makes use of React portals to render a JSONSchema editor. To
render the editor you need to create a `schema.json` and `ui.json` file in the
directory of the fragment for the JSON data of the form.

No variable is needed for this fragment, except for global variables.

[Global variables](/docs/global-variables) are documented as well and have been omitted from this page.
