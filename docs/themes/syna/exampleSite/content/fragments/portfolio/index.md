List of images and descriptions of what you work on

<!--more-->

Portfolio fragment can display up to 3 images in a row, which get realigned
responsively. Title and subtitle are shown as overlays. An additional
description can be provided and shown as a modal upon clicking the portfolio. In
the case a `item_url` is provided the portfolio will redirect to the specified url
instead of opening the modal.
