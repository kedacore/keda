  The following code is used to fetch the fragments for each page and calling
  them. The code is complicated and written in Go Template so it's even more
  complicated. Hopefully the comments would help.

  We want the fragment to be as natural as possible. In that case, a single page
  and a blog and an even more complex structure wouldn't be hard to implement.
  The following structure is how we work right now.

  There are several kinds of pages in Hugo; Page, Section, Homepage for example.
  We expect that a homepage and section are defined as follows:

  _index.md
  _index
    index.md
    fragment-1.md
    fragment-2.md

  Hugo only requires _index.md file to define homepage or section, but Syna
  requires the special _index directory for the fragments to be defined in
  there. When rendering a section or a homepage, _index directory is expected so
  the fragments can be found.
  
  And any page would be configured either as single index.md file or a directory
  containing the index.md file and it's fragments.

  page
    index.md
    fragment-1.md
    fragment-2.md

  Or:

  page.md

  This way, any page would have a main .md file and it's .md resources which
  would define the fragments.

  In every section, there can be another special directory called _global. This
  directory is optional to have in the sections, but it's nice to have at the
  root section, where you can place nav and footer fragments and not duplicate
  them in every page. Each page will lookup each section's _global directory and
  render them from child to root parent. So in the following structure only
  marked files would be rendered in case of the page /blog/author-1/article-1:

  _index.md
  _index
    index.md
  _global
    index.md
    nav.md
    contact.md
    content.md
    footer.md # Rendered
  blog
    _global
      index.md
      nav.md # Rendered
      contact.md # Rendered
    author-1
      _global
        index.md
        item.md # Rendered
      article-1
        index.md
        content.md # Rendered

  The following code looks for each _global directory in upper sections, removes
  duplicates (with priority given to closest fragments to the actual page) and
  call the partials.
