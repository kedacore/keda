We provide a few approaches to deploy KEDA in your Kubernetes clusters:

- Operator framework
- Helm charts
- Azure Function Core Tool
- YAML declarations

Don't see what you need? Feel free to [create an issue]() on our GitHub repo.

## Deploying with a Helm chart

Deploying KEDA with Helm is very simple:

1. Add Helm repo

```cli
helm repo add kedacore https://kedacore.azureedge.net/helm
```

2. Update Helm repo
```cli
helm repo update
```

3. Install `keda-edge` Helm chart

```cli
helm install kedacore/keda-edge --devel --set logLevel=debug --namespace keda --name keda
```

You can use our ARM image instead by adding `--set image.tag=arm` to your helm install command.

## Deploying with the Azure Functions Core Tools
KEDA supports autoscaling a variety of workloads which include Azure Functions and is included in their [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools).

Here is how you can easily install KEDA with their CLI:
```
func kubernetes install --namespace keda
```

## Deploying using the deploy yaml
If you want to try KEDA on minikube or a different Kubernetes deployment without using Helm you can still deploy it with `kubectl`.

We provide sample YAML declarations which includes our CRD - You can find them in our `/deploy` directory on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kedacore/keda).

```
kubectl apply -f deploy/crds/keda.k8s.io_scaledobjects_crd.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/crds/keda.k8s.io_triggerauthentications_crd.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/
```
