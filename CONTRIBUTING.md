# Contributing to KEDA

Thanks for helping make KEDA better üòç.

There are many areas we can use contributions - ranging from code, documentation, feature proposals, issue triage, samples, and content creation.  

## Getting Help

If you have a question about KEDA or how best to contribute, the [#KEDA](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CKZJ36A5D) channel on the Kubernetes slack channel ([get an invite if you don't have one already](https://slack.k8s.io/)) is a good place to start.  We also have regular [community stand-ups](https://github.com/kedacore/keda#community-standup) to track ongoing work and discuss areas of contribution.  For any issues with the product you can [create an issue](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/issues/new) in this repo.

## Contributing Scalers

One of the easiest ways to contribute is adding scalers.  Scalers are the logic on when to activate a container (scaling from zero to one) and also how to serve metrics for an event source.  You can view [the code for existing scalers here](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/tree/master/pkg/scalers).  When writing a scaler, please consider:

1. Is this an event source that many others will access from Kubernetes? If not, potentially consider [creating an external scaler](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/blob/master/pkg/scalers/externalscaler/externalscaler.proto).
1. Include tests
1. Include documentation and examples for [keda.sh](https://keda.sh) via [https://github.com/kedacore/keda-docs](https://github.com/kedacore/keda-docs)

Information on how scalers work can be found in [`CREATE-NEW-SCALER`](CREATE-NEW-SCALER.md).

## Including Documentation Changes

For any contribution you make that impacts the behavior or experience of KEDA, please open a corresponding docs request for [keda.sh](https://keda.sh) through [https://github.com/kedacore/keda-docs](https://github.com/kedacore/keda-docs).  Contributions that do not include documentation or samples will be rejected.
