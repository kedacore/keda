# Release Process

The release process of a new version of KEDA involves the following: 

## 0. Prerequisites

Look at the last released version in the releases page: https://github.com/kedacore/keda/releases
For example: currently it is 1.1.0
The next version will thus be 1.2.0

## 1. Update KEDA version in code and YAMLs

* Run the following command to update the version, setting the `VERSION` value to the next version, eg 1.2.0:
    ```bash
    VERSION=1.2.0 make release
    ```
    > Note: This will update the version labels and images in the yaml files located in the `deploy` folder as well as the version in `version.go`.
* Commit these changes.

## 2. Changelog

Provide a new section in `CHANGELOG.md` for the new version that is being released along with the new features, patches and deprecations it introduces. 

It should not include every single change but solely what matters to our customers, for example issue template that has changed is not important.

## 3. Deploy the new KEDA images to Docker Hub

The Docker Hub repo with all the different images can be seen here: https://hub.docker.com/r/kedacore/keda/tags

Creating a new release in the the releases page (https://github.com/kedacore/keda/release) will trigger a GitHub workflow which will create a new image with the latest code and tagged with the next version (in this example 1.2.0) and also change the latest tag to point to this image as well.

## 4. Publish documentation for new version

Publish documentation for new version on https://keda.sh.

See [docs](https://github.com/kedacore/keda-docs#publishing-a-new-version).

## 5. Update Helm Charts

a). Update the version and appVersion here:  https://github.com/kedacore/charts/blob/master/keda/Chart.yaml 
b). In the image section update the keda and metricsAdapter to point to the docker images from step 1 https://github.com/kedacore/charts/blob/master/keda/values.yaml

Then run the commands here: https://github.com/kedacore/charts

-- To deploy KEDA through Azure Functions Core Tools --

Update the following file: 
https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools/blob/dev/src/Azure.Functions.Cli/StaticResources/keda.yaml
[Search for 1.1.0 etc. and replace it]

## 6. Create Helm release on GitHub

Create Helm release on GitHub with changelog of what changed to our Helm chart.
