# Release Process

The release process of a new version of KEDA involves the following:

## 0. Prerequisites

Look at the last released version in the releases page: https://github.com/kedacore/keda/releases
For example: currently it is 2.3.0
The next version will thus be 2.4.0

## 1. Changelog

Provide a new section in `CHANGELOG.md` for the new version that is being released along with the new features, patches and deprecations it introduces.

It should not include every single change but solely what matters to our customers, for example issue template that has changed is not important.

## 2. Add the new version to GitHub Bug report template
Add the new released version to the list in `KEDA Version` dropdown in [3_bug_report.yml](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/3_bug_report.yml).

## 3. Publish documentation for new version

Publish documentation for new version on https://keda.sh.

See [docs](https://github.com/kedacore/keda-docs#publishing-a-new-version).

## 4. Create KEDA release on GitHub

Creating a new release in the releases page (https://github.com/kedacore/keda/releases) will trigger a GitHub workflow which will create a new image with the latest code and tagged with the next version (in this example 2.4.0).

KEDA Deployment YAML file (eg. keda-2.4.0.yaml) is also automatically created and attached to the Release as part of the workflow.

> Note: The container registry repo with all the different images can be seen [here](https://github.com/orgs/kedacore/packages?repo_name=keda)

### Release template

Every release should use the provided template below to create the GitHub release and ensure that a new GitHub Discussion is created.

> ðŸ’¡ Don't forget to update the version & new contributors in the template

## 5. Setup continous container scanning with Snyk

In order to continuously scan our new container image, they must be imported in our [Snyk project](https://app.snyk.io/org/keda/projects) for all newly introduced tags.

Learn more on how to do this through the [Snyk documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-container/image-scanning-library/github-container-registry-image-scanning/scan-container-images-from-github-container-registry-in-snyk).

> Note: Remember to enable the check `Without issues` in order to get the new version listed since probably it hasn't got any issue.

## 6. Prepare our Helm Chart

Before we can release our new Helm chart version, we need to prepare it:

- Update the `version` and `appVersion` in our [chart definition](https://github.com/kedacore/charts/blob/master/keda/Chart.yaml).
- Update the CRDs & Kubernetes resources based on the release artifact (YAML)

## 7. Ship new Helm chart

Guidance on how to release it can be found in our [contribution guide](https://github.com/kedacore/charts/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#shipping-a-new-version).

### Deploy KEDA through Azure Functions Core Tools (optional)

Update the following files with the release artifact (YAML):

- https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools/blob/v3.x/src/Azure.Functions.Cli/StaticResources/keda-v2.yaml
- https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools/blob/v4.x/src/Azure.Functions.Cli/StaticResources/keda-v2.yaml

## 8. Prepare next release

Prepare next release by creating a [new GitHub milestone](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/milestones/new) called `v{upcoming-semver-version}` with a target date in 3 months as per our [release governance](https://github.com/kedacore/governance/blob/main/RELEASES.md).
