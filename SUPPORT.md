Welcome to KEDA! We use GitHub for tracking bugs and feature requests but here are some pointers to get help.

## Documentation

The `#keda` channel is usually the place where people offer support.

## Kubernetes Support

The supported window of Kubernetes versions with KEDA is known as "N-2": (N (Latest release) - 2 (minor versions)).

However, maintainers can dedide to extend this by supporting more minor versions based on the required CRDs being used; but there is no guarantee.
