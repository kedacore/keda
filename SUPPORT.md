## Kubernetes Support

The supported window of Kubernetes versions with KEDA is known as "N-2": (N (Latest release) - 2 (minor versions)).

However, maintainers can decide to extend this by supporting more minor versions based on the required CRDs being used; but there is no guarantee.

You can learn more about the currently supported Kubernetes version in our [FAQ](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/faq/).
