Migration Notes
================

**DO NOT MERGE**

- We need better documentation on HTTP-based scaling with Osiris (This was started here but not finished? https://github.com/kedacore/keda/wiki/Using-Azure-Functions-with-Keda-and-Osiris)
- We need documentation on those scalers
    - Does prometheus support metric and/or query based scaling?
    - Is the external scaler even correct?
