Example: - Rule scoped to the root of a resource with a status subresource: {\"rule\": \"self.status.actual \u003c= self.spec.maxDesired\"}\n\nIf the Rule is scoped to an object with properties, the accessible properties of the object are field selectable via `self.field` and field presence can be checked via `has(self.field)`. Null valued fields are treated as absent fields in CEL expressions. If the Rule is scoped to an object with additionalProperties (i.e. a map) the value of the map are accessible via `self[mapKey]`, map containment can be checked via `mapKey in self` and all entries of the map are accessible via CEL macros and functions such as `self.all(...)`.

Examples: - Rule scoped to a map of objects: {\"rule\": \"self.components['Widget'].priority \u003c 10\"} - Rule scoped to a list of integers: {\"rule\": \"self.values.all(value, value \u003e= 0 \u0026\u0026 value \u003c 100)\"} - Rule scoped to a string value: {\"rule\": \"self.startsWith('kube')\"}\n\nThe `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the object and from any x-kubernetes-embedded-resource annotated objects.
