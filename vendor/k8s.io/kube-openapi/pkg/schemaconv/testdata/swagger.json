Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available.

Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.\n\nThe server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests.

If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.\n\nThe server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available.

This field is not supported if watch is true.\n\nThe server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.\n\nThe server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, and \"rules\" only included `apiGroups:[\"apps\"], apiVersions:[\"v1\"], resources: [\"deployments\"]`, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the webhook.\n\nDefaults to \"Equivalent\"",

The `self` variable in the CEL expression is bound to the scoped value. Example: - Rule scoped to the root of a resource with a status subresource: {\"rule\": \"self.status.actual \u003c= self.spec.maxDesired\"}\n\nIf the Rule is scoped to an object with properties, the accessible properties of the object are field selectable via `self.field` and field presence can be checked via `has(self.field)`. Null valued fields are treated as absent fields in CEL expressions. If the Rule is scoped to an object with additionalProperties (i.e. a map) the value of the map are accessible via `self[mapKey]`, map containment can be checked via `mapKey in self` and all entries of the map are accessible via CEL macros and functions such as `self.all(...)`. If the Rule is scoped to an array, the elements of the array are accessible via `self[i]` and also by macros and functions. If the Rule is scoped to a scalar, `self` is bound to the scalar value. Examples: - Rule scoped to a map of objects: {\"rule\": \"self.components['Widget'].priority \u003c 10\"} - Rule scoped to a list of integers: {\"rule\": \"self.values.all(value, value \u003e= 0 \u0026\u0026 value \u003c 100)\"} - Rule scoped to a string value: {\"rule\": \"self.startsWith('kube')\"}\n\nThe `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the object and from any x-kubernetes-embedded-resource annotated objects. No other metadata properties are accessible.\n\nUnknown data preserved in custom resources via x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields is not accessible in CEL expressions. This includes: - Unknown field values that are preserved by object schemas with x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields. - Object properties where the property schema is of an \"unknown type\". An \"unknown type\" is recursively defined as:\n  - A schema with no type and x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields set to true\n  - An array where the items schema is of an \"unknown type\"\n  - An object where the additionalProperties schema is of an \"unknown type\"\n\nOnly property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible. Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression: - '__' escapes to '__underscores__' - '.' escapes to '__dot__' - '-' escapes to '__dash__' - '/' escapes to '__slash__' - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '__{keyword}__'. The keywords are:\n\t  \"true\", \"false\", \"null\", \"in\", \"as\", \"break\", \"const\", \"continue\", \"else\", \"for\", \"function\", \"if\",\n\t  \"import\", \"let\", \"loop\", \"package\", \"namespace\", \"return\".\nExamples:\n  - Rule accessing a property named \"namespace\": {\"rule\": \"self.__namespace__ \u003e 0\"}\n  - Rule accessing a property named \"x-prop\": {\"rule\": \"self.x__dash__prop \u003e 0\"}\n  - Rule accessing a property named \"redact__d\": {\"rule\": \"self.redact__underscores__d \u003e 0\"}\n\nEquality on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type of 'set' or 'map' ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1].

Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.\n\nWhen a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.\n\nBefore serializing, Quantity will be put in \"canonical form\". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:\n\n- No precision is lost - No fractional digits will be emitted - The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.\n\nThe sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.\n\nExamples:\n\n- 1.5 will be serialized as \"1500m\" - 1.5Gi will be serialized as \"1536Mi\"\n\nNote that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.\n\nNon-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)\n\nThis format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.",

The primary sort is based on VersionPriority, ordered highest to lowest (20 before 10). Since it's inside of a group, the number can be small, probably in the 10s. In case of equal version priorities, the version string will be used to compute the order inside a group. If the version string is \"kube-like\", it will sort above non \"kube-like\" version strings, which are ordered lexicographically. \"Kube-like\" versions start with a \"v\", then are followed by a number (the major version), then optionally the string \"alpha\" or \"beta\" and another number (the minor version). These are sorted first by GA \u003e beta \u003e alpha (where GA is a version with no suffix such as beta or alpha), and then by comparing major version, then minor version. An example sorted list of versions: v10, v2, v1, v11beta2, v10beta3, v3beta1, v12alpha1, v11alpha2, foo1, foo10.",
