/*
Package nerdgraph provides a programmatic API for interacting with the New Relic
NerdGraph GraphQL API.  It can be used to run freeform queries and mutations. The
GraphiQL API explorer is a useful resource for learning about what is available via
the NerdGraph API:

# Authentication

You will need a valid Personal API key to communicate with the backend New Relic
API that provides this functionality.  See the API key documentation below for
