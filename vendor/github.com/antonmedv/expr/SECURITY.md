# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Expr is generally backwards compatible with very few exceptions, so we
recommend users to always use the latest version to experience stability,
performance and security.

We generally backport security issues to a single previous minor version,
unless this is not possible or feasible with a reasonable effort.

| Version | Supported          |
|---------|--------------------|
| 1.15    | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.14    | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.13    | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.12    | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.12  | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've discovered a serious vulnerability, please contact the
Expr core team at anton+security@medv.io. We will evaluate your report and if
necessary issue a fix and an advisory. If the issue was previously undisclosed,
we'll also mention your name in the credits.
