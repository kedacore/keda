**Expr** is a Go-centric expression language designed to deliver dynamic configurations with unparalleled accuracy, safety, and speed.

```js
// Allow only admins and moderators to moderate comments.
user.Group in ["admin", "moderator"] || user.Id == comment.UserId
```

```js
// Ensure all tweets are less than 240 characters.
all(Tweets, .Size <= 240)
```

## Features

**Expr** is a safe, fast, and intuitive expression evaluator optimized for the Go language. 
Here are its standout features:

### Safety and Isolation
* **Memory-Safe**: Expr is designed with a focus on safety, ensuring that programs do not access unrelated memory or introduce memory vulnerabilities.
* **Side-Effect-Free**: Expressions evaluated in Expr only compute outputs from their inputs, ensuring no side-effects that can change state or produce unintended results.
* **Always Terminating**: Expr is designed to prevent infinite loops, ensuring that every program will conclude in a reasonable amount of time.

### Go Integration
* **Seamless with Go**: Integrate Expr into your Go projects without the need to redefine types.

### Static Typing
* Ensures type correctness and prevents runtime type errors.
  ```go
  out, err := expr.Compile(`name + age`)
  // err: invalid operation + (mismatched types string and int)
  // | name + age
  // | .....^
  ```

### User-Friendly
* Provides user-friendly error messages to assist with debugging and development.

### Flexibility and Utility
* **Rich Operators**: Offers a reasonable set of basic operators for a variety of applications.
* **Built-in Functions**: Functions like `all`, `none`, `any`, `one`, `filter`, and `map` are provided out-of-the-box.

### Performance
* **Optimized for Speed**: Expr stands out in its performance, utilizing an optimizing compiler and a bytecode virtual machine. Check out these [benchmarks](https://github.com/antonmedv/golang-expression-evaluation-comparison#readme) for more details.
