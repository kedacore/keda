// Package amp provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for Amazon
// Prometheus Service.
//
// Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is a serverless, Prometheus-compatible
// monitoring service for container metrics that makes it easier to securely
// monitor container environments at scale. With Amazon Managed Service for
// Prometheus, you can use the same open-source Prometheus data model and query
// language that you use today to monitor the performance of your containerized
// workloads, and also enjoy improved scalability, availability, and security
// without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.
//
// For more information about Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, see the [Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus] User
// Guide.
//
// Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus includes two APIs.
//
//   - Use the Amazon Web Services API described in this guide to manage Amazon
//     Managed Service for Prometheus resources, such as workspaces, rule groups, and
//     alert managers.
//
//   - Use the [Prometheus-compatible API]to work within your Prometheus workspace.
