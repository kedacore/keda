// Package cloudwatch provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// Amazon CloudWatch.
//
// Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services)
// resources and the applications you run on Amazon Web Services in real time. You
// can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are the variables you
// want to measure for your resources and applications. CloudWatch alarms send
// notifications or automatically change the resources you are monitoring based on
// rules that you define. For example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads
// and writes of your Amazon EC2 instances. Then, use this data to determine
// whether you should launch additional instances to handle increased load. You can
// also use this data to stop under-used instances to save money. In addition to
// monitoring the built-in metrics that come with Amazon Web Services, you can
// monitor your own custom metrics. With CloudWatch, you gain system-wide
// visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational
// health.
