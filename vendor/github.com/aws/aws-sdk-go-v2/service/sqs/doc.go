// Package sqs provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for Amazon
// Simple Queue Service.
//
// Welcome to the Amazon SQS API Reference. Amazon SQS is a reliable,
// highly-scalable hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between
// applications or microservices. Amazon SQS moves data between distributed
// application components and helps you decouple these components. For information
// on the permissions you need to use this API, see Identity and access management (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-authentication-and-access-control.html)
// in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide. You can use Amazon Web Services SDKs (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk)
// to access Amazon SQS using your favorite programming language. The SDKs perform
// tasks such as the following automatically:
//   - Cryptographically sign your service requests
//   - Retry requests
//   - Handle error responses
//
