# Azure Event Hubs Client Module for Go

[Azure Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs/) is a big data streaming platform and event ingestion service from Microsoft. For more information about Event Hubs see: [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about).

Use the client library `github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/messaging/azeventhubs` in your application to:

- Send events to an event hub.
- Consume events from an event hub.

## Getting started

### Install the package

Install the Azure Event Hubs client module for Go with `go get`:

```bash
go get github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/messaging/azeventhubs
```

### Prerequisites

- Go, version 1.18 or higher
- An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- An [Event Hub namespace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/).
- An Event Hub. You can create an event hub in your Event Hubs Namespace using the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create), or the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-quickstart-cli).

### Authenticate the client

Event Hub clients are created using a TokenCredential from the [Azure Identity package][azure_identity_pkg], like [DefaultAzureCredential][default_azure_credential].
You can also create a client using a connection string.

# Key concepts

An Event Hub [**namespace**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-features#namespace) can have multiple event hubs. Each event hub, in turn, contains [**partitions**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-features#partitions) which store events.

Events are published to an event hub using an [event publisher](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-features#event-publishers). In this package, the event publisher is the [ProducerClient](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/messaging/azeventhubs#ProducerClient)

Events can be consumed from an event hub using an [event consumer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-features#event-consumers). In this package there are two types for consuming events: 
- The basic event consumer is the, in the [ConsumerClient](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/messaging/azeventhubs#ConsumerClient). This consumer is useful if you already known which partitions you want to receive from.
- A distributed event consumer, which uses Azure Blobs for checkpointing and coordination. This is implemented in the [Processor](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/messaging/azeventhubs#Processor). This is useful when you want to have the partition assignment be dynamically chosen, and balanced with other Processor instances.

# Examples

Examples for various scenarios can be found on [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/messaging/azeventhubs#pkg-examples) or in the example*_test.go files in our GitHub repo for [azeventhubs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/blob/main/sdk/messaging/azeventhubs).

# Troubleshooting

### Logging

This module uses the classification-based logging implementation in `azcore`. To enable console logging for all SDK modules, set the environment variable `AZURE_SDK_GO_LOGGING` to `all`. 

Use the `azcore/log` package to control log event output or to enable logs for `azeventhubs` only. For example:

```go
import (
  "fmt"
  azlog "github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azcore/log"
)

// print log output to stdout
azlog.SetListener(func(event azlog.Event, s string) {
    fmt.Printf("[%s] %s\n", event, s)
})

// pick the set of events to log
azlog.SetEvents(
  azeventhubs.EventConn,
  azeventhubs.EventAuth,
  azeventhubs.EventProducer,
  azeventhubs.EventConsumer,
)
```
