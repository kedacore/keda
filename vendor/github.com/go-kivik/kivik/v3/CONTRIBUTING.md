# Contributing

Kivik is an open source project, and contributions are always welcome.

Contributing to Kivik involves very little formal procedure.  Anyone is
encouraged to file bug reports, feature requests, or submit PRs.  PRs are not
guaranteed to be accepted, but they are guaranteed to be reviewed and discussed.
For any large-scale change, opening an issue to discuss the change prior to
submitting a PR is probably appropriate, to avoid possibly wasting time on an
implementation that may not be accepted.

## Licensing

Kivik is licensed under the Apache license, version 2.0. All code contributions
to this project are therefore also contributed under the same license. **If you
are uncomfortable with, or unable to comply with this** (perhaps due to legal
limitations imposed by your employer), **DO NOT SUBMIT CODE**! You are still
welcome to participate in bug reports and discussions.
