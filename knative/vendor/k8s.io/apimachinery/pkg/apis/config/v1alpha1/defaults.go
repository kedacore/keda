// RecommendedDefaultClientConnectionConfiguration defaults a pointer to a
// ClientConnectionConfiguration struct. This will set the recommended default
// values, but they may be subject to change between API versions. This function
// is intentionally not registered in the scheme as a "normal" `SetDefaults_Foo`
// function to allow consumers of this type to set whatever defaults for their
// embedded configs. Forcing consumers to use these defaults would be problematic
// as defaulting in the scheme is done as part of the conversion, and there would
// be no easy way to opt-out. Instead, if you want to use this defaulting method
// run it in your wrapper struct of this type in its `SetDefaults_` method.
