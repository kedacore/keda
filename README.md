KEDA allows for fine-grained autoscaling (including to/from zero) for event driven Kubernetes workloads. KEDA serves
as a Kubernetes Metrics Server and allows users to define autoscaling rules using a dedicated Kubernetes custom
resource definition.

KEDA can run on both the cloud and the edge, integrates natively with Kubernetes components such as the Horizontal
Pod Autoscaler, and has no external dependencies.

We are a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) sandbox project.
