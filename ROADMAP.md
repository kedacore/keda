# Roadmap

KEDA uses [GitHub issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) to track open work items with [GitHub Projects (beta)](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects) to plan for upcoming releases.

This document provides insights to the community on how we use it and what to expect.

You can find our roadmap [here](https://github.com/orgs/kedacore/projects/2).

## Upcoming Release Cycles

As part of our [release governance](https://github.com/kedacore/governance/blob/main/RELEASES.md), we are planning to release a new KEDA version every 4 months following a predictable schedule that avoids slow seasons (summer holidays, Christmas). Releases are scheduled for January, May, and September, with our plan being to release during the 2nd week of the month (though this is an estimate that could change).

For more details about this new release schedule, see [this issue](https://github.com/kedacore/governance/issues/122).

Here is an overview of our current release estimations:

| Version | Estimated Release Date                               |
|:--------|:-----------------------------------------------------|
| v2.20   | 2nd week of May 2026                                |
