# Roadmap

KEDA uses [GitHub issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) to track open work items with [GitHub Projects (beta)](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects) to plan for upcoming releases.

This document provides insights to the community on how we use it and what to expect.

You can find our roadmap [here](https://github.com/orgs/kedacore/projects/2).
